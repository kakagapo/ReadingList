# Oil, 2nd Edition by Vaclav Smil

## Chapter 5: How long will oild last?

- virtually inaccessible oil will be there forever
- if interested only in commercial production then at least till end of 21st century
- examples of source from which extracting might not be profitable - oild sands, oil shales and tar deposits
- dependence of crude oil/petroleum is a recent phenomenon - after 1960s in Europe and Japan - after 1980s in Asia
- So, loosig crude oil is not going to send us to stone age
- Coal was the main fuel of 19th century and still is a major source of electricity generation in India and China
- Other source compared is natural gas
- Natural gas home heaters (high-efficiency ones) are now converting 97-98% of the chemical energy in methane into heat
- Compared to that fuel oil furnances were only 50% efficient
- shale oil extraction is relatively new and has been a success in US
- oil sands in canada
- 2 methods for extraction from sand. Both of them use steam to reduce viscosity of the oil and then extract the free flowing oil
  - cyclic steam-simulation (CSS)
  - steam-aasisted drainage (SAGD)

## Classification in terms of quality

- Light oil - API gravity of at least 25 degrees
- Medium heavy - 20 to 25 degrees
- Heavy - 10 to 20 degrees
- Bitumen - less than 10 degrees
- Oil shales - minimal or virtually no permeability
  
## Units used in the book

bpd - barrels per day
API gravity - index of the density of a crude oil or refined products

## Abbreviations

API - American Petroleum Institute
