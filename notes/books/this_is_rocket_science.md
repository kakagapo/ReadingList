Saltpeter - potassium nitrate - found in dry caves in southern China.
Alchemists used saltpeter to dissolve ores and minerals
Made pure sulphur by heating iron pyrite (fool's gold)
Discovered that if saltpeter, sulphur and carbon were combined the mixture would burn
1040 A.D. - a Chinese official descibed three combinations of these ingredients - a poison-smoke ball, a bomb that burned and a bomb that exploded(bot not violently)
Later experminets showed that when extra saltpeter was added to the three main ingredients the combination exploded with greater force (cmae to be known as huo yao, the earliest form of gunpowder)
