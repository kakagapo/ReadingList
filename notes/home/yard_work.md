# Yard work

Polymeric sand is used to fill the gaps between pavers. I believe it provides structural integrity but holding the pavers in place.
It forms a bond and sets when it comes in contact with water. So make sure that there is no moisture on the pavers when you spread the sand.
Use a broom to move the sand from the surface of the pavers into the gaps.
