## Painting

- When stripping paint watch out for lead in old building. Based on wikipedia lead was added for the following reasons - "accelerate drying, increase durability, maintain a fresh appearance, and resist moisture that causes corrosion"
- When stripping make sure not to damage the wall. Use a sander instead of any other scraping tool.

## Bathroom
 
 - Wall should be plumb (perfectly vertical) before fixing tiles
 - Use cement board as base for tiles
 - Use spacers if required
 - Consider using Kerdi boards as they are waterproof 

## Plumbing
