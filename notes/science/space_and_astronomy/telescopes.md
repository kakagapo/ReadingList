# Optical telescopes

## 3 Main Types

- refractor
- reflector
  - Dobsonian
  - Newtonian
- catadioptric aka compound
  - Schmidt-Cassegrain
  - Maksutovâ€“Cassegrain  

### Refractor

- Uses lenses
- Tube should be long enough to be able to focus the light, so the larger the lens(large aperture) the longer the tube
- doublets (has Color fringing aka Chromatic aberration issues) vs triplets

### Reflectors

- Uses mirrors
- Image will be upside down
- does not have color fringing issues seen in doublet refractors
- reqiures Collimation

## Eyepieces

- 25 mm , 10 mm -> The smaller the number the greater the magnification

Magnification formula:

```text
Magnification = Focal length of telescope / Focal length of the eyepiece
```

- Since the eyepiece focal length is in the denominator the lower that value the higher the magnification.
