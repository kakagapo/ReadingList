## 3 Main Telescope Types

- refractor
- reflector
  - Dobsonian -> refers to the mount type. 
  - Newtonian
- catadioptric aka compound (uses both refracting and reflecting elements)
  - Schmidt-Cassegrain
  - Maksutovâ€“Cassegrain  

### Refractor

- Uses lenses
- Tube should be long enough to be able to focus the light, so the larger the lens(large aperture) the longer the tube
- doublets (has Color fringing aka Chromatic aberration issues) vs triplets

### Reflectors

- Uses mirrors
- Image will be upside down
- does not have color fringing issues seen in doublet refractors
- reqiures Collimation
- Look for paraboloic mirror and not spherical mirror

## Telescope Mount types

### Equatorial Mount
### Dobsonian Mount

Alt-azimuth type mount and is very easy to use. Not suitable for astrophotography as automated tracking is difficult.

## Eyepieces

- 25 mm , 10 mm -> The smaller the number the greater the magnification

Magnification formula:

```text
Magnification = Focal length of telescope / Focal length of the eyepiece
```

- Since the eyepiece focal length is in the denominator the lower that value the higher the magnification.
