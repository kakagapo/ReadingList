# Geology

## Scree vs talus

## Rock types

1) Igneous rocks - Basalt, Andesite, Ryolite, Granite, Gabbro, etc.
2) Metamorphic rocks - Marble, etc.
3) Sedimentary rocks - Limestone, Sandstone, Andesite, Obsidian

## Minerals

- Quartz - crystalline mineral composed of silica

## Terms

- karst - Karst is a topography formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum

## Flood basalts of Pacific Northwest

- [Youtube - Flood Basalts of the Pacific Northwest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQhjkemEyUo)
- Sits on top of old rocks
- Columbia river basalt group(associated with Yellowstone hotspot) and Chilcotin group
- Yellowstone hotspot - North American tectonic plate moves over it and creates calderas when it erupts
- Link between mass extinctions and flood basalt activity
- Active basaltic eruption going on in Hawaii

### Timeline of lava flows

- Initial - 16 to 17 Million year ago (MYA) - 7% of flow
- Main - 15.6 to 16 MYA - 90%
- Waning - 6 to 15.6 MYA - 3%

### How to find a fissures

- Find a feeder dikes (vertical basalt inbetween horizontally layered rocks)
- Spatter(lava thrown into the air by expanding gases) ramparts and cones are also seen

### Comparision of flood basalt provinces

|Pacific NW - 45 Million acres | 50 K |
| India(Deccan) | 370 | 2.5x |
| Pangea | 2,700 | 12x |
| Siberia | 1,700 | 20x |
