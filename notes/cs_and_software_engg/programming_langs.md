## Java

## Python

- [Memory Management](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/memory.html)
- [Garbage Collector Design](https://devguide.python.org/internals/garbage-collector/index.html)
  - Mainly based on reference counts (won't help with cycles)
  - Since cycles are limited container objects they are tracked separately and scanned periodically for reachability. To be able to scan through all the objects they should have a link between them. That is done by maintaining pointers to prev and next objects, thereby making it a doubly linked-list.

## Go

## Rust

- Ownership is used to eliminate the following classes of bugs
  - dangling pointers
  - double frees
  - using uninitialized memory

### Learning resources

- https://developers.google.com/edu/c++/getting-started

```cpp
using namespace std;
vector<string> a = { "hi", "how", "are", "you" };
vector<string> b = a;
```

The above code ends up making deep copies of `a`.
