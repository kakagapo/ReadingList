# Software engineering and design patterns

## SOLID principles

`Single-responsibility` - every class should have only one responsibility
`Openâ€“closed` principle - Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
`Liskov substitution` principle - Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
`Interface segregation` principle - Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.
`Dependency inversion` principle - Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.

## Other OOPs principles

- `Composition over inheritance`
