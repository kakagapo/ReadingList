# Personal project ideas:

## Loading to time series database
- Setup a feeder file in some text format
- Background process will pickup the data and insert it into a sorted time series file
- Create a visualization that is capable of showing the timeseries better


## Personal projects:
- Feed the data into neo 4j graph database

## Graph algorithms
- Topo sort jobs and come up with a job execution plan
